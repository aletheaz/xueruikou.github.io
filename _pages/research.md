## ["China's Intellectual-property Supply Chain and Evidence of Under-reported U.S. to Tax Haven Transactions"](../assets/Underreported_IP_web.pdf)

**Abstract:**  We use a modified gravity model to incorporate the difference between tax havens and non-tax havens in terms of the productivity of a country's imports as they relate to its exports. We hypothesize that, controlling for export level, tax havens have lower reported imports compared to the true value. This lower value of imports reflects the artificially low transfer pricing by MNEs. Our model is focused on trade in intangibles assets because the pricing of this trade is more difficult for any tax authorities to observe. The analysis relies on unique country-level bilateral data on services trade, which is the Balanced Trade in Services Datasets (BaTiS) published by the OECD and the WTO. Using a fixed-effect model, we find evidence consistent with a pattern of under-reported intellectual property values that move from the US to a third country and ultimately to China. The proportional distortion is roughly 35%. The sizeable distortion, however, is less apparent when we aggregate to total services, of which intellectual property is a component. This finding is consistent with the argument that intangible assets are the most important source of profit shifting.

## "Foreign Direct Investment Responses to the 2018 US Corporate Tax Reform"

**Abstract:**  This paper investigates the response of US multinational enterprises to the one-time repatriation tax reduction by repatriating their cash holdings abroad. We infer from the reinvestment of earnings data, which is a component of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to solve the data issue. To overcome these challenges, our empirical strategy leverages the observation that, while the permanent drop in CIT in the US affects its FDI in all foreign countries, the one-time reduction in repatriation tax only influences the countries where US MNEs have substantial amounts of unrepatriated earnings. We adopt an event study methodology, where the event is the enactment of the TCJA and the treatment group is the tax haven countries, to estimate the causal impact of the one-time reduction in repatriation tax. We find distinct dynamic effects of the reduction on foreign investment and repatriation. In the short run (1-2 years after the enactment), we observe a significant reduction in FDI outflows to tax havens, driven predominantly by reinvestment of earnings and adjustments in services industries. Over the long term, these effects appear to bounce back to zero. These results suggest that MNEs chose to repatriate their foreign income soon after the TCJA went into effect despite having an 8-year window for the repatriation tax reduction. Hence, we provide evidence supporting the effectiveness of the tax reduction.

## Corporate Taxation and Foreign Patent Citation

**Abstract:**  The growing importance of intellectual property as a channel in tax avoidance presents challenges for tax authorities. MNEs strategically relocate valuable IPs to low-tax affiliates. We estimate a multinomial logit model that incorporates observed and unobserved heterogeneity in firmsâ€™ location choices.
