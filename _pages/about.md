Welcome! My name is Xuerui Kou.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Economics](https://business.unl.edu/academic-programs/departments/economics/) at [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/). 

My research is primarily related to the interaction between international trade and public economics, especially international tax avoidance, using a wide range of datasets, reduced-form analysis and structural models.

Feel free to contact me at xkou2@huskers.unl.edu at anytime.
